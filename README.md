# Statistics-Lab-Teaching-Notes
This repository contains my notes, homework assignments, and in-class code examples for my teaching of Statistics Laboratory at Vanderbilt University. I first taught this course in the Spring Semester of 2018.

The course has 3 main portions:
- A four-week introduction to programming taught in R
- A four-week unit on statistical modelling including regression analysis, support vector machines, and decision trees. This unit balances theoretical statistics theory with an emphasis on practical applications with built in R functionality.
- A two-week unit on hypothesis testing

Each folder will contain notes for each week's lesson and associated homework assignments, diagrams, plots, and in-class codes. Lab 5 also contains a sample video lesson on the theory of linear least squares regression.
